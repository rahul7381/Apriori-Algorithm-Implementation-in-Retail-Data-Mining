# Apriori-Algorithm-Implementation-in-Retail-Data-Mining

This report presents the implementation and analysis of association rule mining in retail transactions using Python. The project encompasses three main parts: data generation, Apriori algorithm implementation, and comparison with existing algorithms. By following the project requirements and input-output specifications, we explore the effectiveness and efficiency of the Apriori algorithm in uncovering associations within retail datasets.
